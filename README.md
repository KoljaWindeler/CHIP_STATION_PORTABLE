# CHIP_STATION_PORTABLE
This project is about a better and gaming compatible housing for C.H.I.P.

PocketChip is a great toy to play with, but the keys tend to be hard to push and make some hard click noises. 
The PSP seems like the perfect housing for a CHIP.

Just to mention some features:
 - it has a parallel display that was almost compatible with chip (only requires small amount of hardware)
 - many buttons (4 for the directions + 4 [x,y,a,b] + 2 shoulder buttons + menu buttons (vol+, vol-, ...) ..)
 - status LEDs for power / charging controllable on the LOW end (+5V is directly connected to the LED) 
 - 3.7V lipo battery which should work directly with chips battery circuit
 - 5V input for charging, perfect for chip
 
The purpose of this project is to create a mainboard that acts as an adapter between C.H.I.P. and the PSP.
It shall have the same form factor as the original PSP mainboard and connect easy to the existing flex connectors,
e.g. the buttons and the display. It shall also carry the DC/DC converter circuit to power the display backlight
and accomplish the conversion of the display signals. It shall also provide the required software and firmware files
for chip to use the PSP hardware.
